Section 5 - Forms & Tables

Tables
- Data tables. Tabular data.
- td = table data (represents single cell) that contains data in a table
- tr = table row, represents a row of cell in the table
- th = table header
- thead = table header
- tbody = breaks table into logical sections (wraps row)
- tfoot = table footer

HTML Forms
- The <form> element itself is a shell/container of elements to build the form
- The action attribute specifies where the data should be sent
- The method attribute specifies which kind of HTTP request should be used

Input Types
- 20+ different input types within a form
- The type attribute determines how the input is going to behave

Form Labels
- Labels are very important in terms of accessibility 
- You can link the label and input with the for & ID attribute 
- When you associate a label and input, it makes the label clickable to trigger the input

Form Button
- By default a button is submittable if it's within a form element
- The attribute type "button" will tell the browser to handle it only as a button and not submittable

Name attribute:
- Name is used for the name that passes to the sever connected to the data. Eg. username = tyrellc
- This will indicate when the data is sent what it is labelled as
- This helps us correctly process the data that is sent via inputs
- With radio button groups, using the same name will group those radio buttons so only a single radio is selectable within that group

Radio buttons:
- If a value attribute is not set,  the value sent will simply be 'on'.
